 * repository contains the most up-to-date version of this code. Do not work
 * out of any other repositories.
 *
 * Bug fixes in the use of the PHP language
 *  - You may make these bug fixes at any time so long as you comitt the
 *    fixes to the correct repository.
 *
 * Refactoring code to suit project coding guidelines
 *  - Don't ask, just do it (please).
 *  - Inform everyone that you've done it so they can adjust any hooks their
 *    programme has into this library.
 *  - Remove this part of the message once the library has been refactored

 *
 * Making changes to the algorithm
 *  - Changes in the algorithm must not be made without applying applicable
 *    changes to the c# version of this code first. The two code bases must
 *    remain in sync with each other. This ensures that all tools behave
 *    in the same predictable manner. If you cannot do this, ask someone who
 *    can.

 *	 will be included in the official trunk.
